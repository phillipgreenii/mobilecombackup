Use agent spec-implementation-engineer to start implementing $ARGUMENTS. Follow the development workflow on how to mark it as active. When working on the implementation, prioritize working on one task at a time. The code should be in a state where it can compile and all tests pass before marking a task as complete.  When finished with a task, commit only those files in which you modified. When the issue is complete be sure to update both the details of the issue and `issues/specification.md` to ensure they match the implementation. If there is a conflict, ask me.
