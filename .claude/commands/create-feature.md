Use agent product-doc-sync to create a new feature issue: $ARGUMENTS

**Feature Creation Workflow:**

1. **Determine issue number**:
   - Find the highest issue number across all FEAT-XXX and BUG-XXX files in issues/ directory
   - Use the next sequential number for the new feature (e.g., if highest is FEAT-039, use FEAT-040)

2. **Create feature document**:
   - Copy `issues/feature_template.md` to `issues/backlog/FEAT-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
   - Use kebab-case naming convention for the descriptive name
   - Fill out the template sections based on the provided description

3. **Complete specification**:
   - Fill in all template sections with appropriate detail
   - Ask clarifying questions as needed to properly complete the specification
   - Ensure the feature has clear requirements and acceptance criteria

4. **Auto-commit the new feature**:
   - Check git status to confirm only the new feature file is staged
   - Commit with proper message format:
   ```
