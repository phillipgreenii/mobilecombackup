# BUG-050: Path Traversal Vulnerability

## Status
- **Reported**: 2025-01-14
- **Priority**: critical
- **Severity**: blocker

## Overview
Multiple locations using filepath.Join with user input lack path validation, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks that could access files outside the repository.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Identify locations where filepath.Join is used with user-controlled input
2. Attempt to provide paths with "../" sequences
3. Observe potential to escape repository boundaries

## Expected Behavior
All file paths should be validated to ensure they remain within the repository root directory.

## Actual Behavior
No validation of file paths allows potential directory traversal attacks.

## Environment
- All versions
- All platforms

## Root Cause Analysis
### Root Cause
Missing input validation on file paths allows directory traversal sequences like "../" to potentially access files outside the intended repository directory.

## Fix Approach
Implement a comprehensive PathValidator with the following design:

```go
// pkg/validation/path.go
type PathValidator struct {
    BaseDir string
}

func NewPathValidator(baseDir string) *PathValidator
func (v *PathValidator) ValidatePath(userPath string) (string, error)
func (v *PathValidator) JoinAndValidate(elem ...string) (string, error)
```

**Validation Algorithm:**
```go
func (v *PathValidator) ValidatePath(userPath string) (string, error) {
    // 1. Clean the path (removes . and .. elements)
    cleaned := filepath.Clean(userPath)
    
    // 2. Make absolute if relative  
    if !filepath.IsAbs(cleaned) {
        cleaned = filepath.Join(v.BaseDir, cleaned)
    }
    
    // 3. Resolve symlinks to real path
    real, err := filepath.EvalSymlinks(cleaned)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid path: %w", err)
    }
    
    // 4. Verify within base directory
    absBase, _ := filepath.Abs(v.BaseDir)
    if !strings.HasPrefix(real, absBase) {
        return "", ErrPathOutsideRepository
    }
    
    // 5. Return path relative to base directory
    return filepath.Rel(absBase, real)
}
```

**Error Types:**
```go
var (
    ErrPathOutsideRepository = errors.New("path would access files outside repository")
    ErrInvalidPath          = errors.New("path contains invalid characters or sequences") 
    ErrPathTooLong          = errors.New("path exceeds maximum length")
)
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Validation overhead: < 1ms per path
- Support for 10,000+ path validations without significant slowdown
- Consider caching for repeated validations of same paths

**Attack Vectors to Address:**
- Directory traversal: `../../../etc/passwd`
- Absolute paths: `/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32\config`
- Symlink attacks: symlinks pointing outside repository
- Unicode/encoding attacks: `%2e%2e%2f`
- Null byte injection (legacy but worth defending against)

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Design and Implementation
- [ ] Design PathValidator interface with clear function signatures
- [ ] Implement path validation function in `pkg/validation/path.go`
- [ ] Define specific validation rules (canonicalization, prefix checking, symlink resolution)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests including fuzzing tests

### Phase 2: Complete Vulnerability Assessment  
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Complete audit of ALL filepath.Join and path construction usage:

**High-Risk Locations (user-controlled input):**
  - `pkg/attachments/storage.go:27,134`: Hash used in path construction 
  - `pkg/attachments/reader.go`: Multiple hash-based path operations
  - `pkg/autofix/autofix.go:650,659`: File paths from validation violations
  - `cmd/mobilecombackup/cmd/import.go`: User-provided import paths
  - `cmd/mobilecombackup/cmd/init.go:25,49`: Repository root path handling

**Medium-Risk Locations (internal but needs validation):**  
  - `pkg/calls/writer.go:25`: Year-based file paths
  - `pkg/sms/writer.go`: Similar year-based paths  
  - `pkg/importer/rejection_writer.go:28`: Rejection file paths
  - `pkg/validation/*.go`: Multiple file path constructions

**Migration Strategy:**
- [ ] Add compatibility mode for existing repositories  
- [ ] Create migration tool to validate existing file structures
- [ ] Document backward compatibility guarantees

### Phase 3: Implementation and Testing
- [ ] Fix highest risk locations first (user input paths)
- [ ] Add path validation to all identified vulnerable locations
- [ ] Create security test suite with attack vector testing
- [ ] Add integration tests for actual file access attempts
- [ ] Performance testing for validation overhead

### Phase 4: Security Review
- [ ] Internal security review of implementation
- [ ] Consider penetration testing
- [ ] Update security documentation

## Testing
### Security Test Suite
- Test valid paths are accepted
- Test "../" sequences are rejected in all variations
- Test absolute paths are handled correctly (`/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows`)
- Test symlink attacks (symlinks pointing outside repository)  
- Test Unicode/encoded path attacks (`%2e%2e%2f`)
- Test null byte injection attempts
- Test very long paths that might bypass validation
- Test Windows vs Unix path difference handling
- Fuzzing tests for path validation function

### Verification Steps
1. Attempt all documented attack vectors
2. Verify paths are constrained to repository root
3. Test that error messages don't leak path information
4. Performance test validation overhead
5. Integration test with actual file access attempts

### Penetration Testing
- Consider external security review
- Test against OWASP path traversal attack patterns
- Validate fix effectiveness with security tools
