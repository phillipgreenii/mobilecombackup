# FEAT-074: Dependabot Dependency Management

## Status
- **Completed**: 
- **Priority**: medium

## Overview
Enable GitHub Dependabot on the repository to automatically monitor, alert, and create pull requests for dependency updates, security vulnerabilities, and version maintenance. This ensures the project stays current with security patches and dependency updates while maintaining stability.

## Background
Manual dependency management is time-consuming and error-prone. Dependencies can become outdated, introducing security vulnerabilities or missing beneficial improvements. Dependabot provides automated dependency monitoring that:

- Scans for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Creates pull requests for dependency updates with appropriate testing
- Maintains dependency freshness without manual intervention
- Provides clear upgrade paths and changelogs

The mobilecombackup project uses Go modules and would benefit from automated dependency management for both direct and indirect dependencies, especially security-critical packages like XML parsing libraries.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Enable Dependabot security alerts for vulnerability detection
- [ ] Configure automatic dependency updates for Go modules
- [ ] Set up pull request automation with appropriate scheduling
- [ ] Configure update grouping to reduce PR noise
- [ ] Enable semantic versioning awareness for update strategies
- [ ] Set up automatic merging for low-risk updates (patch versions)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Pull requests should not overwhelm the repository (max 5 open PRs)
- [ ] Updates should respect semantic versioning constraints
- [ ] Security updates should be prioritized over feature updates
- [ ] Updates should trigger CI/CD pipeline for validation
- [ ] Configuration should be version-controlled and auditable

## Design
### Approach
Implement Dependabot using GitHub's native integration with a `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration file that defines:

1. **Package Ecosystems**: Configure for Go modules
2. **Update Schedule**: Weekly updates for regular dependencies, daily for security
3. **Reviewers and Assignees**: Automatic assignment for PR reviews
4. **Grouping Strategy**: Group related updates to reduce PR volume
5. **Version Constraints**: Respect semantic versioning and compatibility
6. **Auto-merge Rules**: Define criteria for automatic merging

### API/Interface
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml structure
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "gomod"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    reviewers:
      - "@phillipgreenii"
    groups:
      production:
        patterns:
          - "*"
        exclude-patterns:
          - "*test*"
          - "*dev*"
```

### Data Structures
```yaml
# Dependabot configuration schema
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: string      # "gomod"
    directory: string             # "/" 
    schedule:
      interval: string            # "daily" | "weekly" | "monthly"
      day: string                 # "monday" | etc.
      time: string               # "09:00"
    open-pull-requests-limit: int # max concurrent PRs
    reviewers: []string          # GitHub usernames/teams
    assignees: []string          # PR assignees
    groups:                      # Update grouping
      group-name:
        patterns: []string       # dependency patterns
        exclude-patterns: []string
```

### Implementation Notes
- Use GitHub's built-in Dependabot service (no external dependencies)
- Configuration file must be in `.github/dependabot.yml`
- All updates will trigger existing CI/CD pipeline automatically
- Security updates take precedence over regular updates
- Weekly schedule prevents overwhelming the maintainer while staying current
- Group related dependencies to reduce review overhead

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration file
- [ ] Configure Go module ecosystem monitoring
- [ ] Set up weekly update schedule with appropriate timing
- [ ] Configure pull request reviewers and assignees
- [ ] Set up dependency grouping to reduce PR noise
- [ ] Enable security vulnerability alerts in repository settings
- [ ] Configure automatic merging rules for patch updates
- [ ] Test configuration with a minor dependency update
- [ ] Document Dependabot workflow in project documentation
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline integration with Dependabot PRs

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Validate dependabot.yml syntax and structure
- Test configuration parsing and validation
- Verify grouping rules work as expected

### Integration Tests
- Create test PR to verify CI/CD integration
- Test automatic merging rules with patch update
- Verify security alert notifications work
- Test reviewer assignment functionality

### Edge Cases
- Handle dependency conflicts between grouped updates
- Manage updates that break CI/CD pipeline
- Handle large version jumps (major version updates)
- Deal with discontinued or archived dependencies

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Too many pull requests overwhelming the maintainer
  - **Mitigation**: Limit concurrent PRs to 5, use weekly schedule, group related updates
- **Risk**: Automatic updates breaking the build
  - **Mitigation**: All updates trigger CI/CD, manual review for major versions
- **Risk**: Security updates not being applied quickly enough
  - **Mitigation**: Configure daily schedule for security updates specifically
- **Risk**: Dependency conflicts in grouped updates
  - **Mitigation**: Separate grouping for production vs development dependencies

## Notes
- Initial configuration should be conservative (weekly updates, manual merge)
- Monitor PR volume for first month and adjust grouping/scheduling as needed
- Consider enabling GitHub Security Advisories for better vulnerability tracking
- May want to exclude development-only dependencies from automatic updates
- Should coordinate with existing pre-commit hooks and quality gates (FEAT-072)
