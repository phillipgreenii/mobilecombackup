# FEAT-081: Test Performance Optimization

## Overview
Implement comprehensive test performance optimizations including parallel execution, result caching, and intelligent test selection to significantly reduce test execution time on slower hardware.

## Problem Statement
Test execution is slow, particularly on older hardware, causing:
- Long wait times for feedback during development
- Reluctance to run tests frequently
- Delayed detection of issues
- Reduced developer productivity
- Timeout issues in CI/CD pipelines

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Parallel Test Execution**
   - Run independent tests concurrently
   - Optimize CPU core utilization
   - Maintain test isolation and correctness
   - Support configurable parallelism level

2. **Test Result Caching**
   - Cache test results between runs
   - Invalidate cache on relevant changes
   - Skip unchanged package tests
   - Provide cache hit/miss statistics

3. **Intelligent Test Ordering**
   - Run recently failed tests first
   - Prioritize frequently failing tests
   - Run fast tests before slow tests
   - Group related tests for efficiency

4. **Test Mode Optimization**
   - Support `-short` flag for quick feedback
   - Separate unit from integration tests
   - Skip expensive tests during development
   - Full test mode for pre-commit

5. **Build Optimization**
   - Incremental builds where possible
   - Build cache management
   - Parallel compilation
   - Precompiled test binaries

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: 50-70% reduction in test execution time
2. **Reliability**: No false positives from optimizations
3. **Visibility**: Clear reporting of optimizations applied
4. **Compatibility**: Works with existing test infrastructure

## Design Approach

### Optimization Strategies
```yaml
optimizations:
  parallel-execution:
    default-workers: "num-cpu-cores"
    configurable: true
    expected-improvement: "40-60%"
  
  test-caching:
    cache-location: ".test-cache/"
    invalidation: "content-hash"
    expected-improvement: "30-50%"
  
  smart-ordering:
    strategies:
      - fail-fast
      - quick-first
      - related-groups
    expected-improvement: "10-20%"
  
  build-optimization:
    incremental: true
    cache: true
    expected-improvement: "20-30%"
```

### Implementation Components
```bash
# New test commands
devbox run test-fast    # Parallel + cache + short mode
devbox run test-smart   # Intelligent test selection
devbox run test-cached  # Use cached results where valid

# Enhanced existing command
devbox run tests --parallel --cache --profile
```

### Cache Management
```go
type TestCache struct {
    Results     map[string]TestResult
    FileHashes  map[string]string
    LastRun     time.Time
    HitRate     float64
}

func (tc *TestCache) ShouldRun(pkg string) bool {
    // Check if package files changed
    // Check if dependencies changed
    // Check cache age
    // Return whether test should run
}
```

### Parallel Execution Strategy
```go
type ParallelRunner struct {
    Workers     int
    TestQueue   chan TestPackage
    Results     chan TestResult
    FailFast    bool
}

func (pr *ParallelRunner) Run() {
    // Distribute tests across workers
    // Collect results
    // Handle fail-fast if enabled
    // Report progress in real-time
}
```

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution framework
- [ ] Create test result caching system
- [ ] Add cache invalidation logic
- [ ] Implement intelligent test ordering
- [ ] Add test mode selection (short/full)
- [ ] Create build optimization system
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Implement progress reporting
- [ ] Create cache management commands
- [ ] Add configuration options
- [ ] Optimize test database setup/teardown
- [ ] Create benchmark comparisons
- [ ] Document optimization strategies

## Testing Requirements
1. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure baseline test execution time
   - Compare optimized vs non-optimized runs
   - Track improvement percentages

2. **Correctness Tests**
   - Verify parallel execution maintains isolation
   - Test cache invalidation accuracy
   - Ensure no tests are incorrectly skipped

3. **Stress Tests**
   - High parallelism levels
   - Large test suites
   - Memory-constrained environments

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 50%+ reduction in typical test execution time
- [ ] Parallel execution works correctly
- [ ] Cache invalidation is accurate
- [ ] No false positives or skipped tests
- [ ] Clear performance metrics reporting
- [ ] Configuration options documented
- [ ] Works on resource-constrained hardware
- [ ] Integration with existing workflow

## Dependencies
- Complements FEAT-080 (Context-Aware Verification)

## Priority
HIGH - Critical for developer experience on slower hardware

## Estimated Effort
- Implementation: 12-15 hours
- Testing: 5-6 hours
- Benchmarking: 2-3 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours
- Total: 21-26 hours

## Notes
- Start with parallel execution as highest impact
- Consider gotestsum for better test output
- May need to adjust for different hardware profiles
- Consider distributed testing for CI/CD
- Monitor for test flakiness introduced by parallelism
