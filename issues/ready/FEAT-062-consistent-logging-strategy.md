# FEAT-062: Implement Consistent Logging Strategy

## Status
- **Priority**: low

## Overview
Replace the current mix of fmt.Printf and custom logging with a consistent structured logging approach throughout the application.

## Background
The application currently uses a mix of fmt.Printf calls and custom logging functions, resulting in inconsistent log formats that are difficult to parse and process programmatically.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Replace all fmt.Printf logging with structured logging
- [ ] Implement consistent log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Support both human-readable and JSON log formats
- [ ] Allow log level configuration
- [ ] Provide context-aware logging with request IDs/operation IDs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Logging should have minimal performance impact
- [ ] Log format should be machine-parseable
- [ ] Should integrate well with log aggregation systems
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing output expectations

## Design
### Approach
Implement a structured logging interface that can be injected throughout the application, replacing direct fmt.Printf calls.

### API/Interface
```go
// Structured logging interface
type Logger interface {
    Debug() *zerolog.Event
    Info() *zerolog.Event
    Warn() *zerolog.Event
    Error() *zerolog.Event
    With() *zerolog.Context
}

// Context-aware logging
type ContextLogger interface {
    Logger
    WithContext(ctx context.Context) Logger
    WithFields(fields map[string]interface{}) Logger
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Use a structured logging library like zerolog or logrus
- Implement logger injection rather than global logger usage
- Support both console and JSON output formats
- Include contextual information like operation IDs
- Make logging configuration flexible

## Tasks
- [ ] Choose and integrate structured logging library
- [ ] Design logging interface and context patterns
- [ ] Replace fmt.Printf calls with structured logging
- [ ] Add log level configuration support
- [ ] Implement context-aware logging with operation IDs
- [ ] Add logging configuration options
- [ ] Create logging guidelines and examples
- [ ] Test logging in various scenarios

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test log level filtering
- Test structured log output format
- Test context propagation in logging

### Integration Tests
- Test logging throughout full application workflows
- Test log format consistency

### Edge Cases
- Logging during error conditions
- High-volume logging scenarios
- Logging with context cancellation

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing log parsing tools or scripts
  - **Mitigation**: Provide backward-compatible output options
- **Risk**: Performance impact from structured logging
  - **Mitigation**: Use efficient logging library and make detailed logging optional

## Notes
This improvement will significantly help with production debugging and log analysis. Consider providing migration tools for users who depend on current log formats.
