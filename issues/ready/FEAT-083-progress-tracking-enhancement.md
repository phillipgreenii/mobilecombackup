# FEAT-083: Progress Tracking Enhancement

## Overview
Enhance TodoWrite integration to provide better progress tracking, time estimates, dependency management, and automatic escalation when agents get blocked, improving visibility into task execution and completion.

## Problem Statement
Current TodoWrite usage lacks sophisticated features:
- No time estimates for tasks
- No dependency tracking between tasks
- Limited progress visibility
- No automatic escalation for blockers
- No historical tracking of task completion rates
- Missing integration with issue specifications

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Enhanced Task Metadata**
   - Time estimates (in minutes/hours)
   - Complexity levels (simple/medium/complex)
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Priority levels
   - Blocking status with reasons
   - Retry count for failed attempts

2. **Automatic Task Generation**
   - Parse issue specifications for tasks
   - Generate TodoWrite list from issue structure
   - Include acceptance criteria as subtasks
   - Order tasks by dependencies
   - Add realistic time estimates

3. **Progress Reporting**
   - Real-time progress percentage
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Velocity tracking (tasks/hour)
   - Burndown visualization
   - Blocker alerts and escalation
   - Success/failure rates

4. **Intelligent Task Management**
   - Auto-escalate when blocked >15 minutes
   - Suggest task reordering for efficiency
   - Detect circular dependencies
   - Identify parallelizable tasks
   - Track task completion patterns

5. **Integration Features**
   - `/status` command for current progress
   - Commit task completion to git history
   - Link tasks to code changes
   - Generate completion reports
   - Export metrics for analysis

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Minimal overhead on task execution
2. **Accuracy**: Reliable time estimates based on history
3. **Visibility**: Clear, actionable progress information
4. **Automation**: Reduce manual task management

## Design Approach

### Enhanced TodoWrite Structure
```typescript
interface EnhancedTodo {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'blocked';
  
  // New fields
  estimate?: Duration;        // Time estimate
  complexity?: 'simple' | 'medium' | 'complex';
  dependencies?: string[];    // Task IDs
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  startedAt?: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  blockedReason?: string;
  retryCount?: number;
  linkedCommits?: string[];
}
```

### Task Generation from Issues
```typescript
function generateTasksFromIssue(issue: IssueDocument): EnhancedTodo[] {
  // Parse issue structure
  // Extract tasks from "Tasks" section
  // Add estimates based on complexity
  // Identify dependencies from description
  // Order by priority and dependencies
  return tasks;
}
```

### Progress Tracking System
```typescript
class ProgressTracker {
  tasks: EnhancedTodo[];
  startTime: Date;
  
  getProgress(): ProgressReport {
    return {
      completed: this.completedCount(),
      total: this.tasks.length,
      percentage: this.completionPercentage(),
      timeElapsed: this.elapsedTime(),
      estimatedRemaining: this.estimateRemaining(),
      velocity: this.calculateVelocity(),
      blockers: this.getBlockers(),
      criticalPath: this.getCriticalPath()
    };
  }
  
  escalateBlocker(task: EnhancedTodo) {
    // Alert user about blocker
    // Suggest resolution steps
    // Offer to skip or get help
  }
}
```

### New Commands
```bash
# Show current progress
/status
Output:
  Current Task: Implementing validation logic [2/5]
  Progress: 40% complete (4/10 tasks)
  Time: 1h 23m elapsed, ~2h 10m remaining
  Velocity: 2.9 tasks/hour
  Blockers: None
  
# Generate tasks from issue
/generate-tasks FEAT-XXX
Output:
  Generated 12 tasks from FEAT-XXX
  Estimated time: 4-6 hours
  Dependencies identified: 3
  Ready to begin implementation

# Show task dependencies
/show-dependencies
Output:
  Task dependency graph:
  1 -> 2 -> 3
       â””-> 4 -> 5
  Parallel possible: [2,4], [6,7,8]
```
