# FEAT-027: Ensure Code Formatting in Development Workflow

## Status
- **Completed**: Not started
- **Priority**: medium

## Overview
Update documentation and Claude commands to ensure that code is properly formatted when development tasks are completed. Create a devbox script for formatting if one doesn't already exist.

## Background
Consistent code formatting is essential for maintainability and reducing merge conflicts. Currently, there's no guarantee that code is formatted before completion of development tasks. This feature will ensure all code follows the project's formatting standards.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create or identify a devbox script for code formatting
- [ ] Update all Claude commands to run formatting before completion
- [ ] Update agent documentation to include formatting step
- [ ] Ensure formatting is applied to all Go code

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Formatting should be fast and not impact development workflow
- [ ] Formatting rules should be consistent with project standards

## Design
### Approach
1. Check if a formatting script exists in devbox.json
2. If not, create a `format` or `fmt` script that runs appropriate Go formatting tools
3. Update all Claude command documentation to include formatting step
4. Update agent configurations or documentation as needed

### Implementation Notes
- Use standard Go formatting tools (gofmt, goimports)
- Consider using golangci-lint's formatting capabilities
- Ensure formatting is idempotent

## Tasks
- [ ] Review existing devbox.json for formatting scripts
- [ ] Create formatting script if needed
- [ ] Update Claude command documentation in .claude/commands/
- [ ] Update agent documentation in .claude/agents/
- [ ] Test formatting workflow
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with formatting guidelines

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Verify formatting script works correctly
- Ensure all Go files are properly formatted

### Integration Tests
- Test formatting as part of development workflow
- Verify Claude commands include formatting step

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Formatting might conflict with developer preferences
  - **Mitigation**: Use standard Go formatting tools that are widely accepted
- **Risk**: Formatting might break code in edge cases
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure tests pass after formatting

## Dependencies
None - This is an independent improvement to the development workflow.

## Notes
This will improve code quality and consistency across the project.
