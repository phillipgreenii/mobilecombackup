# FEAT-058: Add Metrics and Observability

## Status
- **Priority**: medium

## Overview
Implement comprehensive metrics collection and observability features to enable monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis of the application in production environments.

## Background
The application currently lacks metrics collection, making it difficult to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and diagnose issues in production deployments.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Prometheus-compatible metrics for operations and performance
- [ ] Structured logging throughout the application
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Performance metrics for key operations
- [ ] Error rate and type tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Minimal performance impact from metrics collection
- [ ] Configurable metrics detail level
- [ ] Standard metrics format for integration with monitoring systems
- [ ] Optional metrics collection (can be disabled)

## Design
### Approach
Implement metrics using Prometheus client library with structured logging and standard observability patterns.

### API/Interface
```go
// Metrics interfaces
type Metrics interface {
    RecordImportDuration(fileType, status string, duration time.Duration)
    IncrementValidationErrors(violationType string)
    RecordFileProcessed(size int64)
    SetActiveOperations(count int)
}

type Logger interface {
    Debug() *zerolog.Event
    Info() *zerolog.Event
    Warn() *zerolog.Event
    Error() *zerolog.Event
}
```

### Data Structures
```go
// Metrics registry
type MetricsRegistry struct {
    ImportDuration    *prometheus.HistogramVec
    ValidationErrors  *prometheus.CounterVec
    FilesProcessed    prometheus.Counter
    ActiveOperations  prometheus.Gauge
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Use Prometheus client library for metrics
- Add structured logging with configurable levels
- Include HTTP endpoints for metrics scraping
- Make metrics collection optional via configuration
- Add tracing support for complex operations

## Tasks
- [ ] Design metrics schema and naming conventions
- [ ] Implement Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Add structured logging throughout application
- [ ] Create HTTP endpoints for metrics scraping
- [ ] Add performance metrics for key operations
- [ ] Implement configurable metrics and logging levels
- [ ] Add metrics collection tests
- [ ] Create observability documentation and dashboards

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test metrics recording accuracy
- Test structured logging output
- Test metrics endpoint functionality

### Integration Tests
- Test metrics collection during full operations
- Test logging in various scenarios

### Edge Cases
- Metrics collection with high concurrency
- Logging during error conditions
- Metrics endpoint security considerations

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Performance impact from extensive metrics collection
  - **Mitigation**: Make metrics collection configurable and lightweight by default
- **Risk**: Sensitive data exposure in logs or metrics
  - **Mitigation**: Implement data sanitization and configurable detail levels

## Notes
This will enable proper monitoring and debugging in production environments. Consider creating example Grafana dashboards and alerting rules as part of the implementation.
