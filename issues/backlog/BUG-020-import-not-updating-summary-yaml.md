# BUG-020: Import doesn't update summary.yaml

## Status
- **Reported**: 2025-08-08
- **Fixed**: 
- **Priority**: high
- **Severity**: major

## Overview
The import command does not create or update the `summary.yaml` file in the repository root, which should contain metadata about the repository contents and last import operations.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Initialize a new repository with `mobilecombackup init`
2. Import data with `mobilecombackup import`
3. Check the repository root for `summary.yaml`
4. Observe that the file is either missing or not updated with import information

## Expected Behavior
After import, `summary.yaml` should exist in the repository root with:
- Last import timestamp
- Summary of imported data (counts by type and year)
- Repository statistics
- Version information

Example structure:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
last_updated: 2025-08-08T10:30:00Z
imports:
  - timestamp: 2025-08-08T10:30:00Z
    calls_added: 125
    sms_added: 340
    attachments_added: 45
statistics:
  total_calls: 1250
  total_sms: 3400
  total_attachments: 450
  years_covered: [2014, 2015, 2016]
```

## Actual Behavior
The `summary.yaml` file is not created or updated during import operations.

## Environment
- Version: Current main branch
- OS: All platforms affected
- Go version: 1.24

## Root Cause Analysis
### Investigation Notes
Need to check if summary.yaml generation was implemented in the import command.

### Root Cause
To be determined during investigation.

## Fix Approach
To be determined after root cause analysis. Will likely need to:
1. Define the summary.yaml structure
2. Implement summary generation after import
3. Handle updates to existing summary files

## Tasks
- [ ] Define summary.yaml structure and format
- [ ] Implement summary generation logic
- [ ] Integrate into import command flow
- [ ] Handle updates to existing summaries
- [ ] Write tests for summary generation
- [ ] Update documentation

## Testing
### Regression Tests
- Test summary creation on first import
- Test summary updates on subsequent imports
- Test with various data types and volumes
- Verify YAML formatting is valid

### Verification Steps
1. Run import on empty repository
2. Verify summary.yaml is created with correct data
3. Run another import
4. Verify summary.yaml is updated appropriately

## Workaround
Users can manually track import operations, but this defeats the purpose of automated metadata tracking.

## Related Issues

- BUG-021: Import not generating files.yaml (similar metadata issue)

## Notes
This is important for repository management and tracking import history. Consider if summary.yaml should also track validation results and other operations.
