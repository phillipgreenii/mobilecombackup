# FEAT-053: Add Golangci-lint Configuration

## Status
- **Priority**: high

## Overview
Add a comprehensive `.golangci.yml` configuration file to ensure consistent code quality checks and catch potential issues early in the development process.

## Background
The project currently uses golangci-lint but lacks a configuration file, which means it's using default settings that may not be optimal for this codebase. A proper configuration will catch more issues and enforce consistent code quality.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create comprehensive .golangci.yml configuration
- [ ] Enable relevant linters for Go best practices
- [ ] Configure appropriate thresholds and settings
- [ ] Exclude test files from certain checks where appropriate

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Configuration should not produce excessive false positives
- [ ] Build process should complete in reasonable time
- [ ] Linting rules should align with project coding standards

## Design
### Approach
Create a comprehensive configuration that enables important linters while maintaining practical usability.

### Implementation Notes
Enable linters for:
- Code quality (gofmt, govet, staticcheck, gosimple)
- Error handling (errcheck)
- Security (gosec)
- Performance (prealloc, bodyclose)
- Style consistency (stylecheck, misspell)
- Code complexity (gocyclo, dupl)

## Tasks
- [ ] Create .golangci.yml with comprehensive linter configuration
- [ ] Test configuration against current codebase
- [ ] Fix any new issues discovered by linters
- [ ] Update CI/devbox configuration if needed
- [ ] Document linting standards in project documentation

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Verify golangci-lint runs successfully with new config
- Test that appropriate issues are caught

### Integration Tests
- Run full linting suite against entire codebase
- Verify CI integration works correctly

### Edge Cases
- Test configuration handles test files appropriately
- Verify performance impact is acceptable

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: New configuration reveals many existing issues
  - **Mitigation**: Gradually enable linters, fix issues incrementally
- **Risk**: Configuration is too strict and hinders development
  - **Mitigation**: Start with moderate settings, adjust based on feedback

## Notes
This will significantly improve code quality consistency and help catch issues early. The configuration should be evolved over time based on team feedback and project needs.
