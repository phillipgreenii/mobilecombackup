# FEAT-059: Improve Generic Types Usage

## Status
- **Priority**: low

## Overview
Leverage Go 1.18+ generics to reduce code duplication and improve type safety throughout the codebase where appropriate.

## Background
The current codebase makes minimal use of Go generics, missing opportunities to reduce code duplication and improve type safety, particularly in areas like result handling, data structures, and common patterns.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Identify opportunities for generic types to reduce duplication
- [ ] Implement generic result and option types
- [ ] Create generic collection utilities where beneficial
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Generic usage should improve code maintainability
- [ ] Should not negatively impact compilation time significantly
- [ ] Should improve type safety without complexity overhead

## Design
### Approach
Identify common patterns that can benefit from generics and implement them incrementally without disrupting existing functionality.

### API/Interface
```go
// Generic result type for operations
type Result[T any] struct {
    Value T
    Error error
}

// Generic paginated response
type Page[T any] struct {
    Items      []T
    Total      int
    PageNumber int
    PageSize   int
}

// Generic optional type
type Optional[T any] struct {
    value *T
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on areas with clear type safety benefits
- Avoid over-engineering with unnecessary generic abstractions
- Consider generic constraints for more specific use cases
- Maintain clear documentation for generic types

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze codebase for generic type opportunities
- [ ] Design generic result and error handling types
- [ ] Implement generic collection utilities
- [ ] Create generic pagination and optional types
- [ ] Update existing code to use generics where beneficial
- [ ] Add tests for generic type implementations
- [ ] Update documentation with generic type usage examples

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test generic types with various concrete types
- Test type safety and constraint validation
- Test generic utility functions

### Integration Tests
- Test generic types in real usage scenarios
- Verify backward compatibility

### Edge Cases
- Generic type inference scenarios
- Complex constraint handling
- Performance with generic types

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Over-engineering with excessive generic abstractions
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on clear wins with measurable benefits
- **Risk**: Increased complexity for minimal benefit
  - **Mitigation**: Only implement generics where they clearly improve the code

## Notes
This is a lower priority enhancement that should be implemented thoughtfully. Focus on areas where generics provide clear benefits rather than applying them everywhere.
