# BUG-050: Path Traversal Vulnerability

## Status
- **Reported**: 2025-01-14
- **Priority**: critical
- **Severity**: blocker

## Overview
Multiple locations using filepath.Join with user input lack path validation, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks that could access files outside the repository.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Identify locations where filepath.Join is used with user-controlled input
2. Attempt to provide paths with "../" sequences
3. Observe potential to escape repository boundaries

## Expected Behavior
All file paths should be validated to ensure they remain within the repository root directory.

## Actual Behavior
No validation of file paths allows potential directory traversal attacks.

## Environment
- All versions
- All platforms

## Root Cause Analysis
### Root Cause
Missing input validation on file paths allows directory traversal sequences like "../" to potentially access files outside the intended repository directory.

## Fix Approach
Implement a path validation function and use it wherever user-provided paths are processed.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create path validation function
- [ ] Identify all locations using filepath.Join with user input
- [ ] Add path validation to all identified locations
- [ ] Write tests for path validation including malicious inputs
- [ ] Security review of fix

## Testing
### Regression Tests
- Test valid paths are accepted
- Test "../" sequences are rejected
- Test absolute paths are handled correctly
- Test symlink handling

### Verification Steps
1. Attempt directory traversal with "../" sequences
2. Verify paths are constrained to repository root
3. Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Notes
This is a critical security vulnerability that should be prioritized for immediate fixing. See OWASP Path Traversal documentation for additional context.
