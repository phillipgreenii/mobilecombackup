# FEAT-079: Issue Preparation Pipeline

## Overview
Create a comprehensive orchestration command `/prepare-issue` that takes an issue from backlog to ready state through multiple agent reviews, ensuring the specification is complete, technically sound, and implementation-ready.

## Problem Statement
Currently, preparing an issue for implementation requires:
- Manual review of specification completeness
- Separate validation of technical design
- Individual assessment of test strategy
- No standardized readiness criteria
- Multiple manual steps to move from backlog to ready
- Inconsistent quality of issue specifications

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Orchestrated Multi-Agent Review**
   - Sequential agent reviews with clean handoffs
   - Each agent commits improvements before passing to next
   - Automatic progression through review pipeline
   - Clear status reporting at each stage

2. **Review Pipeline Stages**
   - **Stage 1: Specification Review** (spec-review-engineer)
     - Validate completeness of requirements
     - Check for ambiguities and gaps
     - Ensure acceptance criteria are clear
     - Commit specification improvements
   
   - **Stage 2: Technical Design Review** (new: technical-design-reviewer)
     - Validate technical approach
     - Check architectural alignment
     - Verify feasibility and constraints
     - Commit design enhancements
   
   - **Stage 3: Test Strategy Review** (new: test-strategy-reviewer)
     - Ensure comprehensive test coverage plan
     - Validate test categories and approaches
     - Add specific test scenarios
     - Commit test plan updates
   
   - **Stage 4: Implementation Planning** (new: implementation-planner)
     - Break down into concrete tasks
     - Add effort estimates
     - Identify dependencies
     - Commit task breakdown
   
   - **Stage 5: Final Readiness Check**
     - Verify all criteria met
     - Move to ready/ directory
     - Commit the transition

3. **Interruption Handling**
   - Support for "needs-human-input" status
   - Clear reporting of blocking issues
   - Ability to resume from last successful stage
   - Rollback capability if major issues found

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time status updates during pipeline
   - Summary report at completion
   - Audit trail of all changes made
   - Time tracking for each stage

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Atomicity**: Each stage completes fully or rolls back
2. **Idempotency**: Safe to re-run on same issue
3. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into pipeline progress
4. **Flexibility**: Configurable review criteria

## Design Approach

### Command Structure
```markdown
/prepare-issue FEAT-XXX [options]
Options:
  --skip-stage <stage>  Skip specific review stage
  --fast               Run minimal reviews
  --strict             Enhanced review criteria
```

### Pipeline Architecture

### New Agent Requirements
1. **technical-design-reviewer**
   - Reviews technical approach and architecture
   - Validates against existing patterns
   - Ensures scalability and maintainability

2. **test-strategy-reviewer**
   - Ensures comprehensive test coverage
   - Adds specific test scenarios
   - Validates testing approach

3. **implementation-planner**
   - Creates detailed task breakdown
   - Adds time/complexity estimates
   - Identifies dependencies

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement pipeline orchestration logic
- [ ] Create technical-design-reviewer agent
- [ ] Create test-strategy-reviewer agent
- [ ] Create implementation-planner agent

   - Verify clean handoffs between stages
   - Test interruption handling

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Test with various issue types
   - Verify commit history is clean
   - Test resume from interruption

3. **Edge Cases**

- [ ] Each stage commits improvements independently
- [ ] Clean git history with descriptive commits
- [ ] Clear progress reporting throughout pipeline
- [ ] Handles interruptions gracefully
- [ ] All review agents provide value-adding improvements
- [ ] Documentation includes pipeline workflow diagram
