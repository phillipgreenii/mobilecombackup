# BUG-040: Attachment Validation Failing in full-test.sh

## Status
- **Reported**: 2025-08-13
- **Priority**: high
- **Severity**: major

## Overview
Validation of attachments is failing when running the full-test.sh script, indicating issues with attachment processing or validation logic that prevent successful testing and deployment.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the full-test.sh script
2. Observe attachment validation step
3. Notice validation failures
4. Test execution may halt or report errors

## Expected Behavior
Attachment validation should pass during full-test.sh execution, confirming that:
- Attachments are properly extracted and stored
- Attachment files match expected content and hashes
- Validation logic correctly verifies attachment integrity
- All attachment-related tests pass successfully

## Actual Behavior
Attachment validation fails during full-test.sh execution, potentially due to:
- Incorrect attachment extraction or storage
- Hash mismatches between expected and actual attachment content
- Missing or corrupted attachment files
- Validation logic errors or incorrect expectations

## Environment
- Version: Current development branch
- Test environment: As configured in full-test.sh
- Related to attachment processing functionality

## Root Cause Analysis
### Investigation Notes
Need to investigate the specific failure points in attachment validation:
- Check attachment extraction process
- Verify hash calculation and storage
- Review validation logic for correctness
- Examine test data and expectations

### Root Cause
To be determined during investigation - likely related to attachment processing changes or validation logic issues.

## Fix Approach
1. Reproduce the validation failure locally
2. Identify specific attachment validation errors
3. Fix underlying attachment processing or validation issues
4. Ensure validation logic matches actual attachment behavior
5. Update tests if validation expectations are incorrect

## Tasks
- [ ] Reproduce attachment validation failure in full-test.sh
- [ ] Identify specific error messages and failure points
- [ ] Investigate attachment extraction and storage process
- [ ] Review attachment validation logic for correctness
- [ ] Fix identified issues in attachment processing or validation
- [ ] Verify fix resolves validation failures
- [ ] Run full-test.sh to confirm all tests pass
- [ ] Update any incorrect test expectations if needed

## Testing
### Regression Tests
- Run full-test.sh to ensure attachment validation passes
- Test attachment extraction with various file types
- Verify attachment hash calculation and validation

### Verification Steps
1. Execute full-test.sh script successfully without attachment validation failures
2. Verify all attachment-related functionality works correctly
3. Confirm attachment files are properly extracted and validated
4. Ensure no regression in other test areas

## Workaround
Temporarily skip attachment validation in full-test.sh if needed to unblock other testing, but this should be addressed promptly as it indicates functional issues.

## Related Issues
- Related features: FEAT-012 (Extract Attachments), FEAT-034 (Fix Attachment Extraction), FEAT-039 (Limit Attachment Extraction)
- Code locations: pkg/attachments/, full-test.sh script
- Testing: Integration test suite

## Notes
This is a high-priority bug as it prevents successful testing and may indicate functional problems with attachment processing. Should be investigated and fixed promptly to maintain testing reliability and ensure attachment functionality works correctly.
