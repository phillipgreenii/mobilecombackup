# FEAT-061: Documentation Improvements

## Status
- **Priority**: low

## Overview
Improve package-level documentation, API documentation, and code examples to make the codebase more accessible to new developers and easier to maintain.

## Background
Some packages lack comprehensive documentation, and there are opportunities to improve API documentation with better examples and usage patterns.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add package-level documentation for all packages
- [ ] Improve godoc documentation for public APIs
- [ ] Add code examples and usage patterns
- [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation
- [ ] Document architecture and design decisions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Documentation should be kept up-to-date with code changes
- [ ] Examples should be tested and verified to work
- [ ] Documentation should be accessible to developers of various skill levels

## Design
### Approach
Systematically review and improve documentation across the codebase, focusing on public APIs and complex functionality.

### Implementation Notes
- Follow Go documentation conventions
- Include working examples that can be tested
- Document not just what code does, but why design decisions were made
- Create clear package hierarchy and relationship documentation

## Tasks
- [ ] Audit existing documentation coverage
- [ ] Add missing package-level documentation
- [ ] Improve godoc comments for public APIs
- [ ] Create example_test.go files with working examples
- [ ] Document architecture and package relationships
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Create developer setup and contribution guide
- [ ] Set up documentation generation and publishing

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test all code examples in documentation
- Verify example code compiles and runs correctly

### Integration Tests
- Test documentation examples in real scenarios

### Edge Cases
- Documentation examples with various input types
- Error handling examples

## Notes
Good documentation is crucial for maintainability and contributor onboarding. Focus on areas where new developers commonly need guidance.
