# FEAT-060: Test Coverage Improvements

## Status
- **Priority**: low

## Overview
Improve test coverage across packages with comprehensive testing strategies including table-driven tests, benchmarks, and fuzzing tests for critical components.

## Background
While the project has good test coverage in many areas, some packages lack comprehensive testing, and there are opportunities to add more sophisticated testing approaches like fuzzing and benchmarking.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 85%+ across all packages
- [ ] Add table-driven tests for edge cases
- [ ] Implement benchmark tests for performance-critical paths
- [ ] Add fuzz testing for parsers and input validation
- [ ] Create integration tests for complex workflows

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Tests should run efficiently in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Fuzz tests should be comprehensive but time-bounded
- [ ] Benchmarks should track performance over time
- [ ] Tests should be maintainable and well-documented

## Design
### Approach
Systematically analyze test coverage and add missing tests using modern Go testing approaches.

### Implementation Notes
- Use Go's built-in testing tools (testing, benchmarking, fuzzing)
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Add performance regression detection through benchmarks
- Include property-based testing where appropriate

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current test coverage across all packages
- [ ] Identify packages with insufficient coverage
- [ ] Add table-driven tests for complex functions
- [ ] Implement fuzz tests for XML parsers and input validation
- [ ] Create benchmark tests for performance-critical operations
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting and tracking
- [ ] Document testing standards and guidelines

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Comprehensive coverage of all public APIs
- Edge case and boundary condition testing
- Error path testing

### Integration Tests
- Full import workflows with various input types
- Validation workflows with different repository states
- Cross-package integration scenarios

### Edge Cases
- Malformed input handling
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Concurrent access patterns

## Notes
Focus on areas that will provide the most value - parsers, validation logic, and core business logic should be prioritized over simple utility functions.
