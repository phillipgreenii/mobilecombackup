# FEAT-055: Add Context Support Throughout Application

## Status
- **Priority**: medium

## Overview
Add context.Context propagation throughout the application to enable graceful cancellation and timeout handling for long-running operations.

## Background
The current codebase lacks context.Context support, making it impossible to gracefully cancel long-running operations like large file imports or validation processes. This is a significant gap for production usage.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add context.Context parameters to key interfaces and functions
- [ ] Implement cancellation handling in long-running operations
- [ ] Support timeout configuration through context
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Operations should respond to cancellation within reasonable time
- [ ] Context cancellation should clean up resources properly
- [ ] Performance impact should be minimal

## Design
### Approach
Gradually introduce context support starting with core interfaces and working outward to implementation details.

### API/Interface
```go
// Update key interfaces to accept context
type CallsReader interface {
    ReadCalls(ctx context.Context, year int) ([]Call, error)
    StreamCallsForYear(ctx context.Context, year int, callback func(Call) error) error
}

type AttachmentStorage interface {
    Store(ctx context.Context, hash string, data []byte, metadata AttachmentInfo) error
    StoreFromReader(ctx context.Context, hash string, data io.Reader, metadata AttachmentInfo) error
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Add context checks at regular intervals in loops
- Use context.WithTimeout for operations with time limits  
- Ensure proper cleanup when context is cancelled
- Update CLI commands to create and pass contexts

## Tasks
- [ ] Design review of context integration approach
- [ ] Update core interfaces to include context parameters
- [ ] Implement context handling in readers and parsers
- [ ] Add context support to validation operations
- [ ] Update CLI commands to create contexts with timeouts
- [ ] Add tests for context cancellation behavior
- [ ] Update documentation with context usage examples

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test context cancellation in various operations
- Test timeout handling
- Test proper resource cleanup on cancellation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end operation cancellation
- Large file processing with timeout

### Edge Cases
- Context cancellation during file I/O
- Multiple nested context cancellations
- Resource cleanup verification

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking API changes for existing interfaces
  - **Mitigation**: Provide adapter functions for backward compatibility
- **Risk**: Performance overhead from frequent context checks
  - **Mitigation**: Add context checks at appropriate intervals, not every iteration

## Notes
This is a foundational improvement that will enable better control over long-running operations. Consider implementing in phases, starting with the most critical operations.
