# FEAT-063: Add Git Hooks Configuration

## Status
- **Priority**: low

## Overview
Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically run code quality checks (formatting, testing, linting) before commits, catching issues early in the development cycle.

## Background
Issues are currently caught late in the development cycle, after code is committed. Pre-commit hooks would catch formatting, testing, and linting issues before they enter the repository.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create pre-commit hook script that runs quality checks
- [ ] Run formatter, tests, and linter before allowing commits
- [ ] Provide easy setup mechanism for developers
- [ ] Allow bypassing hooks for emergency commits
- [ ] Support both local development and CI environments

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Hooks should run quickly to not slow down development
- [ ] Should provide clear error messages when checks fail
- [ ] Should be easy to install and configure
- [ ] Should work across different development environments

## Design
### Approach
Create git hooks that integrate with existing devbox scripts and provide clear setup instructions.

### Implementation Notes
- Use existing devbox scripts for consistency
- Provide installation script for easy setup
- Include bypass mechanism for urgent commits
- Consider using tools like pre-commit or simple shell scripts

## Tasks
- [ ] Create pre-commit hook script
- [ ] Add hook installation and setup instructions
- [ ] Integrate with existing devbox quality scripts
- [ ] Add bypass mechanism for emergency situations
- [ ] Test hooks across different development environments
- [ ] Create developer setup documentation
- [ ] Add hook configuration to project setup guide

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test hook script functionality
- Test bypass mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- Test hooks in real development workflow
- Test behavior with failing checks

### Edge Cases
- Hook behavior with partial commits
- Performance with large commits
- Hook behavior in CI environments

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Hooks slowing down development workflow
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize hook performance and provide bypass options
- **Risk**: Developers bypassing hooks routinely
  - **Mitigation**: Make hooks fast and provide clear value

## Notes
This will help maintain code quality consistency and catch issues before they enter the repository. Keep hooks lightweight and focused on essential quality checks.
