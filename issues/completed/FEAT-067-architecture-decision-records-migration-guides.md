# FEAT-067: Add Architecture Decision Records and migration guides

## Status
- **Reported**: 2025-08-18
- **Completed**: 2025-08-19
- **Priority**: low
- **Type**: documentation

## Overview
The project lacks comprehensive documentation of key design decisions and their rationale. There are no Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) explaining why certain technical choices were made, and no migration guides for users transitioning between versions or API changes.

## Requirements
Create comprehensive documentation including Architecture Decision Records for key design decisions, migration guides for API changes, and improved API documentation to support long-term maintainability and user adoption.

## Design
### Architecture Decision Records Structure
```
docs/adr/
├── 0001-streaming-vs-batch-processing.md
├── 0002-hash-based-attachment-storage.md
├── 0003-xml-parsing-security-approach.md
├── 0004-repository-structure-design.md
├── 0005-development-tool-choices.md
└── template.md
```

### Migration Guides Structure
```
docs/migration/
├── v1.0-to-v1.1.md
├── api-changes/
│   ├── validation-interfaces.md
│   └── error-handling.md
└── breaking-changes.md
```

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: ADR Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Create ADR directory structure and template
- Document existing key architectural decisions
- Establish ADR creation process

### Phase 2: Key Decision Documentation (Week 2-3)  
- Document streaming vs batch processing decision
- Record hash-based attachment storage rationale
- Document XML security approach decisions
- Record development tooling choices

### Phase 3: Migration Guides (Week 4)
- Create API migration guides for interface changes
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Create version upgrade guides

### Phase 4: API Documentation Enhancement (Ongoing)
- Improve public API documentation
- Add usage examples for complex APIs
- Document error conditions and handling

## Tasks
- [ ] Create docs/adr/ directory structure with template
- [ ] Document streaming vs batch processing decision (ADR-0001)
- [ ] Document hash-based attachment storage approach (ADR-0002)  
- [ ] Document XML parsing security decisions (ADR-0003)
- [ ] Document repository structure design (ADR-0004)
- [ ] Document development tool ecosystem choices (ADR-0005)
- [ ] Create migration guide template and structure
- [ ] Write validation interface evolution migration guide
- [ ] Create error handling standardization migration guide
- [ ] Enhance public API documentation with examples
- [ ] Add architectural overview documentation
- [ ] Create ADR process documentation for future decisions

## Architecture Decision Records
### ADR-0001: Streaming vs Batch Processing
**Context**: Need to process large XML files efficiently
**Decision**: Use streaming XML processing with callback patterns
**Rationale**: Memory efficiency, scalability, real-time processing capability
**Consequences**: More complex error handling, callback-based APIs

### ADR-0002: Hash-based Attachment Storage  
**Context**: Need efficient, deduplication-capable attachment storage
**Decision**: SHA-256 hash-based directory structure (attachments/ab/abc123...)
**Rationale**: Content deduplication, integrity verification, scalable organization
**Consequences**: Hash calculation overhead, more complex file organization

### ADR-0003: XML Security Approach
**Context**: Need to parse XML safely without XXE vulnerabilities
**Decision**: Custom secure XML decoder wrapper
**Rationale**: Security by default, centralized protection, compatibility
**Consequences**: Additional abstraction layer, consistent security enforcement

### ADR-0004: Repository Structure Design
**Context**: Need organized, scalable backup repository format
**Decision**: Year-based partitioning with typed directories
**Rationale**: Time-based organization, efficient querying, clear structure
**Consequences**: Year boundary complexity, migration requirements

## Migration Guides
### Validation Interface Evolution
- Guide for migrating from legacy to context-aware methods
- Code examples showing before/after patterns
- Deprecation timeline and compatibility information

### Error Handling Standardization
- Examples of new error wrapping patterns
- Migration from raw errors to structured errors
- Testing considerations for error handling changes

## API Documentation Enhancement
### Public Interface Documentation
- Complete godoc comments for all exported functions
- Usage examples for complex operations
- Error condition documentation
- Interface contract specifications

### Code Examples
- Common usage patterns
- Integration examples
- Testing approaches
- Configuration examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete ADR documentation for 5 key architectural decisions
- [ ] ADR template and process established for future decisions
- [ ] Migration guides available for all breaking changes
- [ ] Enhanced API documentation with examples
- [ ] Architectural overview documentation created
- [ ] Documentation is discoverable and well-organized
- [ ] Examples are tested and up-to-date
- [ ] Migration paths are clear and actionable

## Technical Considerations
### Documentation Maintenance
- Keep ADRs immutable once published
- Update migration guides with new versions
- Regularly validate code examples
- Link documentation to relevant code sections

### Accessibility
- Use clear, consistent formatting
- Provide table of contents for long documents
- Include cross-references between related documents
- Make examples copy-paste friendly

## Documentation Standards
### ADR Format
- Status, context, decision, consequences structure
- Date and author information
- Link to relevant issues or discussions
- Clear rationale with alternatives considered

### Migration Guide Format
- Clear before/after examples
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Testing recommendations
- Rollback procedures where applicable

## Related Issues
- Supports FEAT-064 (interface evolution)
- Supports FEAT-066 (error handling standards)  
- Improves developer onboarding experience
- Enables better architectural decision making

## Notes
Focus on documenting decisions that have significant impact on users or future development. ADRs should capture the thinking behind decisions, not just the final outcome. Migration guides should be practical and include working examples.
