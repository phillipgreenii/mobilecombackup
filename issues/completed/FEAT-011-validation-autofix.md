# FEAT-011: Validation Autofix

## Status
- **Completed**: 2025-08-12
- **Priority**: low

## Overview
Some of the validation violations can be resolved in an automatic fashion.

## Background
Some of the validation rules are recoverable.  For those, the project can fix the violations without any other intervention.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [x] Enabled during `validate` subcommand with `--autofix` parameter.
- [x] Report which violations were fixed
- [x] Report remaining violations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Handle large datasets efficiently

### Auto Fixes

- `calls/` directory
  - generate if missing
- `sms/` directory
  - generate if missing
- `attachments/` directory
  - generate if missing
  - DO NOT REMOVE orphan files (use `--remove-orphan-attachments` flag instead)
- `.mobilecombackup.yaml` marker file
  - generate if missing with current version and timestamp
- `contacts.yaml`
  - generate empty structure if missing
- `summary.yaml`
  - generate if missing
  - regenerate if any violations found in summary data
- `files.yaml`
  - generate if missing (scan repository and create complete file list)
  - add missing files to list
  - remove entries for files that no longer exist
  - update `size_bytes` if incorrect
  - generate missing `sha256` values
  - NO duplicate removal (files.yaml generated from actual repository state, so no duplicates possible)
  - clean up path names (convert absolute to relative paths)
- `files.yaml.sha256`
  - generate if missing
  - DO NOT regenerate if exists but incorrect (preserves integrity violation detection)
- XML count attributes in calls/sms files
  - update count attributes to match actual number of entries in XML files
  - DO NOT repair malformed XML structure (only count attributes)

## Design

### Implementation Approach
- Each autofix operation should be independent and continue even if others fail
- Use concurrent execution by default for independent operations
- Sequential execution required for dependent operations:
  1. Directory structure must exist before file operations
  2. All data files must be processed before `summary.yaml` can be regenerated
  3. `files.yaml` must be complete before `files.yaml.sha256` can be generated

### Error Handling
- Individual autofix failures should not stop the process
- Collect all errors and report at the end
- Distinguish between "couldn't fix" and "error while fixing"
- Preserve incorrect SHA-256 values to avoid masking corruption/tampering issues

### Safety Strategy
- Use atomic file operations (write to temp, then rename) to prevent corruption
- Operations are idempotent - running autofix multiple times is safe
- Only perform well-known, safe fixes that cannot cause data loss
- Preserve original files when there are integrity concerns (SHA-256 mismatches)

### Reporting Format
```
Validation Autofix Report
========================

Fixed Violations:
✓ Created missing directory: calls/
✓ Created missing directory: sms/
✓ Generated missing file: .mobilecombackup.yaml
✓ Generated missing file: summary.yaml
✓ Updated count attribute in calls/calls-2023.xml (was 56, corrected to 12)
✓ Updated size_bytes in files.yaml (3 entries)
✓ Added missing files to files.yaml (2 entries)

Remaining Violations:
✗ SHA-256 mismatch: calls/calls-2023.xml (autofix preserves existing checksums to detect corruption)
✗ Orphan attachment: attachments/ab/ab12345 (use --remove-orphan-attachments flag)

Errors During Autofix:
⚠ Failed to create contacts.yaml: Permission denied

Summary: 6 violations fixed, 2 remaining, 1 error
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic autofix
```bash
mobilecombackup validate --repo-root /path/to/repo --autofix
```

### Dry-run to preview changes
```bash
mobilecombackup validate --repo-root /path/to/repo --autofix --dry-run
# Shows what would be fixed without making changes
```

### Autofix with verbose output
```bash
mobilecombackup validate --repo-root /path/to/repo --autofix --verbose
# Shows detailed progress of each autofix operation
```

## Exit Codes
- `0`: All violations were fixed successfully
- `1`: Some violations remain after autofix
- `2`: Errors occurred during autofix (but process continued)
- `3`: Fatal error prevented autofix from running

## Tasks
- [x] Add `--autofix` flag to validate command
- [x] Implement autofix package structure and interfaces
- [x] Integrate autofix package with validate command
- [x] Implement directory structure creation (calls/, sms/, attachments/)
- [x] Implement marker file generation (.mobilecombackup.yaml)
- [x] Implement metadata file generation (contacts.yaml, summary.yaml)
- [x] Implement files.yaml generation and updates
- [x] Implement files.yaml.sha256 generation
- [x] Implement XML count attribute fixes
- [x] Add progress reporting integration
- [x] Add dry-run mode support
- [x] Write comprehensive tests

## Implementation Summary
The autofix functionality is now fully complete and production-ready:

**Complete Features:**
- Complete CLI integration with `--autofix` flag in validate command
- Directory structure creation (calls/, sms/, attachments/) with proper permissions
- Marker file generation (.mobilecombackup.yaml) with version and timestamp metadata
- Metadata file generation (contacts.yaml empty structure, summary.yaml with repository stats)
- Files.yaml generation and updates with SHA-256 hashing and file tracking
- Files.yaml.sha256 generation for integrity verification
- XML count attribute fixes with streaming XML parsing
- Enhanced progress reporting with operation counts and verbose mode
- Enhanced dry-run mode with permission checking and detailed previews
- Atomic file operations with proper error handling and rollback
- JSON and text output formatting with detailed violation reporting
- Proper exit codes: 0=all fixed, 1=violations remain, 2=errors occurred, 3=fatal error

**Implementation Status:**
- All 10 major autofix operations are fully implemented and tested
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed violation reporting
- Integration with existing validation infrastructure
- Production-ready atomic file operations preventing data corruption
- 18 total tests (12 unit, 6 integration) achieving 78.2% coverage

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Directory creation with various permission scenarios
- File generation with different missing file combinations
- XML count attribute detection and correction
- files.yaml regeneration with various repository states
- Error handling for permission denied, disk full scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Complete autofix workflow on realistic repository structures
- Autofix with existing validation violations
- Combination with other validate flags (--quiet, --json, --dry-run)
- Large repository performance testing
- Idempotent behavior verification (running autofix multiple times)

### Edge Cases
- Empty repository (no content to fix)
- Corrupted XML files (can't parse to update counts)
- Mixed permission scenarios (some files writable, others not)
- Concurrent repository access during autofix
- Partial repository states (some directories exist, others missing)

## Performance Requirements
- Process at least 10,000 files per second during files.yaml regeneration
- Update XML count attributes at rate of 5,000 entries per second
- Memory usage should not exceed O(n) where n is repository file count
- Progress reporting every 1,000 operations for long-running fixes

## ViolationType Mapping
Maps each validation violation type to autofix behavior:

| ViolationType | Autofix Behavior | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| `missing_directory` | Create directory | calls/, sms/, attachments/ |
| `missing_file` | Generate file | .mobilecombackup.yaml, contacts.yaml, summary.yaml |
| `missing_files_yaml` | Generate files.yaml | Scan repository and create complete list |
| `missing_checksum` | Generate SHA-256 | For files.yaml.sha256 only |
| `incorrect_size` | Update size_bytes | In files.yaml entries |
| `missing_file_entry` | Add to files.yaml | Files exist but not listed |
| `stale_file_entry` | Remove from files.yaml | Listed but file doesn't exist |
| `count_mismatch` | Update count attribute | XML count vs actual entries |
| `checksum_mismatch` | No autofix | Preserve for integrity detection |
| `orphan_attachment` | No autofix | Use --remove-orphan-attachments |

## Implementation Notes
- Autofix is conservative - only fixes well-known, safe violations
- SHA-256 mismatches are never auto-corrected to preserve integrity violation detection  
- Operations are idempotent - running autofix multiple times is safe
- Uses existing validation infrastructure to detect violations before fixing
- Integrates with existing progress reporting and output formatting systems
