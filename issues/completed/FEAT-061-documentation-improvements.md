# FEAT-061: Documentation Improvements

## Status
- **Priority**: low
- **Status**: completed
- **Completed**: 2025-08-14

## Overview
Improve package-level documentation, API documentation, and code examples to make the codebase more accessible to new developers and easier to maintain.

## Background
Some packages lack comprehensive documentation, and there are opportunities to improve API documentation with better examples and usage patterns.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add package-level documentation for all packages
- [ ] Improve godoc documentation for public APIs
- [ ] Add code examples and usage patterns
- [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation
- [ ] Document architecture and design decisions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Documentation should be kept up-to-date with code changes
- [ ] Examples should be tested and verified to work
- [ ] Documentation should be accessible to developers of various skill levels

## Design
### Approach
Systematically review and improve documentation across the codebase, focusing on public APIs and complex functionality.

### Implementation Notes
- Follow Go documentation conventions
- Include working examples that can be tested
- Document not just what code does, but why design decisions were made
- Create clear package hierarchy and relationship documentation

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Package Documentation Audit
- [ ] Document specific packages lacking godoc: `pkg/autofix`, `pkg/coalescer`, `pkg/manifest`
- [ ] Add package-level documentation with usage examples for core packages:
  - `pkg/calls`: Call log processing and streaming
  - `pkg/sms`: SMS/MMS processing with attachment handling
  - `pkg/attachments`: Hash-based storage system
  - `pkg/validation`: Repository validation and reporting

### Phase 2: API Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Create `example_test.go` for `pkg/importer` showing full import workflow
- [ ] Add godoc examples for key interfaces: CallsReader, SMSReader, AttachmentStorage
- [ ] Document complex types: ValidationReport, ImportSummary, MMS structure
- [ ] Add usage examples for CLI commands in package documentation

### Phase 3: Developer Documentation
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md documenting package relationships and data flow
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common XML parsing errors
- [ ] Document validation violation types and their meanings
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide with setup and testing instructions

## Specific Documentation Targets
**Priority packages for documentation:**
- `pkg/sms`: Complex MMS handling needs better examples
- `pkg/validation`: Validation types and violation handling
- `pkg/importer`: Integration workflows and error handling
- `pkg/coalescer`: Deduplication logic and entry handling

**Missing documentation areas:**
- Repository structure and file organization
- XML schema expectations and parsing behavior  
- Error handling patterns and custom error types
- Performance characteristics and memory usage

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test all code examples in documentation
- Verify example code compiles and runs correctly

### Integration Tests
- Test documentation examples in real scenarios

### Edge Cases
- Documentation examples with various input types
- Error handling examples

## Notes
Good documentation is crucial for maintainability and contributor onboarding. Focus on areas where new developers commonly need guidance.
