# BUG-055: XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in XML parsers

## Status
- **Reported**: 2025-08-18
- **Fixed**: 2025-08-18 (Core vulnerability resolved)
- **Hardening Completed**: 2025-08-19 (All hardening tasks implemented)
- **Priority**: low (completed)
- **Severity**: minor (fully mitigated)
- **Review Date**: 2025-08-19
- **Review Status**: COMPLETED âœ…

## Current Implementation Status
- âœ… Secure XML decoder wrapper created (`pkg/security/xml.go`)
- âœ… All unsafe xml.NewDecoder calls replaced (verified in 9 files)
- âœ… XXE protection tests implemented (`pkg/security/xml_test.go`)
- âœ… XML security guidelines added to CLAUDE.md
- âœ… Forbidigo linting infrastructure added to .golangci.yml
- ðŸ”§ Forbidigo regex pattern needs refinement (current pattern too broad)

## Overview
~~All XML parsing code in the codebase uses `xml.NewDecoder()` without XXE protection~~ **RESOLVED**: Core XXE vulnerability has been fixed with secure wrapper implementation. Remaining tasks focus on hardening and prevention measures.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create malicious XML file with external entity:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```
2. Process this file through any XML reader in the application
3. Observe that external entities are resolved and sensitive files can be accessed

## Expected Behavior
XML parsers should disable external entity resolution and DTD processing to prevent XXE attacks.

## Actual Behavior
XML parsers resolve external entities, potentially exposing sensitive files and enabling SSRF attacks.

## Environment
- Version: current main branch
- OS: All supported platforms
- Go version: All versions
- Affects all XML parsing functionality

## Root Cause Analysis
### Investigation Notes
Found 8+ instances of `xml.NewDecoder()` without XXE protection:
- `pkg/calls/xml_reader.go:157, 264, 314`
- `pkg/sms/xml_reader.go:65, 767`
- `pkg/importer/calls.go:227`
- `pkg/autofix/autofix.go:698`
- Test files and other locations

### Root Cause
Go's `xml.NewDecoder()` enables external entity resolution by default. No security wrapper is used to disable this dangerous functionality.

## Fix Approach
1. Create secure XML decoder wrapper in `pkg/security/xml.go`
2. Replace all `xml.NewDecoder()` calls with secure wrapper
3. Add regression tests for XXE protection
4. Update documentation with secure XML parsing guidelines

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Create secure XML decoder wrapper function (`pkg/security/xml.go`)
- [x] Audit all xml.NewDecoder usage (9+ instances found and fixed)
- [x] Replace unsafe calls with secure wrapper  
- [x] Add XXE protection regression tests (`pkg/security/xml_test.go`)
- [x] Verify fix prevents XXE attacks
- [x] Document security approach in ADR-0003

## Completed Hardening Tasks âœ…
- [x] Add forbidigo linting rule to prevent direct xml.NewDecoder usage
  - âœ… Add forbidigo configuration to .golangci.yml
  - âœ… Enable forbidigo linter in golangci-lint
  - âœ… Ensure CI pipeline catches violations
- [x] Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with XML security section
  - âœ… Reference existing ADR-0003 (already present)
  - âœ… Summarize implemented security controls (already comprehensive)
- [x] Add security guidelines to CLAUDE.md
  - âœ… Added to security patterns section
  - âœ… Referenced secure XML parsing requirements

## Outstanding Items ðŸ”§
- [ ] **Forbidigo regex refinement**: Current pattern in .golangci.yml is too broad and may need refinement for production use. Pattern needs to be more specific to catch `xml.NewDecoder` while avoiding false positives.

## Testing
### Regression Tests
- Test that external entities are not resolved
- Test that DTD processing is disabled
- Test with various XXE attack payloads
- Verify functionality still works with legitimate XML

### Verification Steps
1. Run security tests with XXE payloads
2. Verify legitimate XML processing still works
3. Confirm no external network requests made during XML parsing
4. Test file disclosure prevention

## Resolution
âœ… **CORE VULNERABILITY FIXED**: Secure XML decoder wrapper implemented and deployed across all XML parsing code. XXE attacks are now prevented.

## Related Issues
- Related to general security hardening
- May relate to input validation improvements
- Code locations: All XML parsing files (8+ instances)

## Review Feedback (2025-08-19) - CORRECTED

### Documentation Verification Complete âœ…
- âœ… **ADR-0003 EXISTS** at `docs/adr/0003-xml-parsing-security-approach.md` and documents XML security approach comprehensively
- âœ… **ARCHITECTURE.md HAS SECURITY SECTION** (lines 205-223) - no XML-specific section needed  
- âœ… **Secure wrapper fully implemented** and deployed across all XML parsing code (11+ usages verified)

### Implementation Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
The core XXE vulnerability has been **successfully fixed and documented**. Remaining hardening tasks are optional and well-defined:

1. **forbidigo linting rule**: Add to `.golangci.yml` configuration to detect `xml.NewDecoder` usage
   ```yaml
   linters-settings:
     forbidigo:
       forbid:
         - p: "xml\\.NewDecoder"
           msg: "Use security.NewSecureXMLDecoder instead of xml.NewDecoder to prevent XXE vulnerabilities"
   ```

2. **CLAUDE.md update**: Add 2-line XML security note:
   ```markdown
   ### XML Security
   - Always use `security.NewSecureXMLDecoder` for XML parsing
   - Direct `xml.NewDecoder` usage is prohibited (XXE vulnerability)
   ```

### Recommendation: MOVE TO READY
This issue should move to `issues/ready/` - the core security vulnerability is resolved and hardening tasks have clear implementation guidance.

### Acceptance Criteria (COMPLETED âœ…)
- [x] Add forbidigo rule to `.golangci.yml` configuration to detect `xml.NewDecoder()` usage
- [x] Enable forbidigo linter in golangci-lint configuration
- [x] Add XML security guidelines to CLAUDE.md as specified above
- [x] Verify forbidigo rule catches direct XML decoder usage in CI pipeline

### Future Enhancement Opportunity
- [ ] **Optional**: Refine forbidigo regex pattern for more precise xml.NewDecoder detection (current pattern functional but broad)

## Notes
**Previous review was incorrect about missing documentation**. All referenced documentation exists and is comprehensive. This is primarily a completed security fix with optional hardening tasks that are ready for implementation.
