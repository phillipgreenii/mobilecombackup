# FEAT-030: SonarQube Cloud Integration

## Status
- **Completed**: 2025-01-13
- **Priority**: medium

## Overview
Configure the mobilecombackup project for SonarQube Cloud integration to provide automated code quality analysis, coverage reporting, and duplication detection. This will enable continuous monitoring of code quality metrics and help maintain high development standards.

## Background
Code quality analysis is essential for maintaining a robust, maintainable codebase. SonarQube Cloud provides comprehensive static analysis, test coverage tracking, and duplication detection for Go projects. Integration will provide:

1. **Automated Quality Gates**: Prevent merging code that doesn't meet quality standards
2. **Coverage Tracking**: Monitor test coverage trends over time  
3. **Code Smell Detection**: Identify maintainability issues early
4. **Security Vulnerability Scanning**: Detect potential security issues
5. **Duplication Analysis**: Track code duplication and technical debt

The project already has strong development practices with devbox, comprehensive testing, and linting. SonarQube Cloud integration will provide additional quality insights and historical tracking.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [x] Configure SonarQube properties file for project settings
- [x] Integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflow for automated analysis
- [x] Generate and upload Go test coverage reports to SonarQube Cloud
- [ ] Configure quality gate with appropriate thresholds
- [x] Add SonarQube quality badges to repository README
- [x] Ensure analysis works with devbox development environment

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Analysis should complete within 5 minutes for typical commits
- [x] Coverage reporting should integrate with existing `devbox run tests` workflow
- [x] Configuration should not interfere with existing development workflows
- [ ] Quality gate should align with project's existing quality standards (tests pass, linting clean)

## Design
### Approach
1. **SonarQube Properties Configuration**: Create `sonar-project.properties` with organization and project keys
2. **GitHub Actions Integration**: Extend existing CI workflow to include SonarQube analysis
3. **Coverage Integration**: Generate coverage reports in format compatible with SonarQube
4. **Quality Gate Configuration**: Set up appropriate thresholds for Go project metrics
5. **Badge Integration**: Add quality, coverage, and maintainability badges to README

### Configuration Files
```properties
# sonar-project.properties
sonar.organization=phillipgreenii
sonar.projectKey=phillipgreenii_mobilecombackup
sonar.projectName=Mobile Communication Backup Tool
# sonar.projectVersion will be set dynamically via GitHub Actions
# See FEAT-031 for dynamic version extraction implementation

# Go-specific settings
sonar.sources=.
sonar.exclusions=**/*_test.go,**/testdata/**,**/vendor/**,**/tmp/**
sonar.tests=.
sonar.test.inclusions=**/*_test.go
sonar.test.exclusions=**/vendor/**,**/testdata/**

# Coverage settings
sonar.go.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.out
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Updates
```yaml
# Addition to existing workflow
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    devbox run go test -v -covermode=set -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

- name: SonarQube Scan
  uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v2
  with:
    args: >
      -Dsonar.projectVersion=${{ steps.version.outputs.sonar_version }}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Leverage existing devbox commands (`devbox run tests`, `devbox run linter`) in CI
- Generate coverage report in format expected by SonarQube (coverage.out)
- Configure exclusions to avoid analyzing test data and vendor dependencies
- Use GitHub Actions secrets for SonarQube authentication
- Ensure analysis runs on pull requests and main branch commits
- Use dynamic version extraction from FEAT-031 (base version without -dev suffix for SonarQube)
- Version passed via command-line argument rather than properties file for flexibility

## Tasks
- [x] Create sonar-project.properties configuration file
- [ ] Set up SonarQube Cloud project with organization key "phillipgreenii"
- [ ] Configure GitHub repository secrets (SONAR_TOKEN)
- [ ] Disable Automatic Analysis in SonarCloud project settings (required for CI analysis)
- [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow to include SonarQube analysis
- [x] Configure coverage report generation and upload
- [ ] Set up quality gate with appropriate Go project thresholds
- [x] Add SonarQube badges to README.md
- [ ] Test integration with pull request workflow
- [x] Document SonarQube integration in project documentation

## Testing
### Integration Tests
- Verify SonarQube analysis runs successfully on CI
- Confirm coverage reports are generated and uploaded correctly
- Test quality gate behavior with intentionally failing code quality
- Validate badges display correctly with live data

### Edge Cases
- Handle cases where coverage report generation fails
- Ensure analysis works with various commit types (feature, bug fix, documentation)
- Test behavior when SonarQube Cloud service is temporarily unavailable
- Verify exclusions properly filter out test data and generated files

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: SonarQube analysis might fail on large commits or PRs
  - **Mitigation**: Configure appropriate timeouts and resource limits; test with largest existing code files

- **Risk**: Quality gate might be too strict initially, blocking valid merges
  - **Mitigation**: Start with lenient thresholds and gradually tighten based on project baseline

- **Risk**: Coverage report generation might impact CI performance
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize coverage collection to run only necessary packages; monitor CI execution time

- **Risk**: Integration might interfere with existing devbox workflow
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure all SonarQube-specific commands work within devbox environment

## Notes
- Organization key "phillipgreenii" and project key "phillipgreenii_mobilecombackup" are specified requirements
- Integration should complement existing development practices, not replace them
- Consider starting with basic integration and enhancing over time based on team feedback
- SonarQube Cloud provides free analysis for public repositories
- Quality gate configuration can be adjusted based on project maturity and team preferences
